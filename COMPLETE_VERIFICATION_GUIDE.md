# Find the process ID
netstat -ano | findstr :3001

# Kill it (replace XXXX with actual PID)
taskkill /F /PID XXXX

# Restart server
node server.js
```

### **Issue 3: "Login not working"**
**Solution:** Verify the exact email and password
```powershell
# Check which emails are in database
node list-employees.js

# Test specific login
node quick-login-test.js
```
