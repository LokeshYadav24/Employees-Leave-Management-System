# Development Documentation

## Project Overview

This Employee Leave Management System was developed as a full-stack web application demonstrating modern web development practices and technologies.

## Technical Decisions

### Backend Architecture
- **Node.js with Express.js**: Chosen for rapid development and excellent JSON handling
- **SQLite Database**: Selected for simplicity and portability - no additional database server required
- **JWT Authentication**: Implemented for stateless, scalable authentication
- **bcrypt**: Used for secure password hashing with salt rounds

### Database Design
```sql
-- Core tables designed for scalability
users (id, name, email, password, role, created_at)
leave_types (id, name, days_per_year, description)
leave_requests (id, user_id, leave_type_id, start_date, end_date, status, reason, created_at)
leave_balances (id, user_id, leave_type_id, allocated_days, used_days, remaining_days)
```

### Security Implementation
- Password hashing with bcrypt (10 salt rounds)
- JWT tokens with expiration
- Role-based access control (Admin, Manager, Employee)
- Input validation using express-validator
- CORS protection for API endpoints

### Frontend Approach
- **Vanilla JavaScript**: Pure JS for better performance and to showcase fundamental skills
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first CSS approach
- **Modern ES6+**: Used arrow functions, async/await, template literals
- **Modular Code**: Separated concerns with different JS modules

## Development Process

### Phase 1: Planning & Design
1. Analyzed requirements for different user roles
2. Designed database schema with normalization
3. Planned RESTful API structure
4. Created wireframes for user interfaces

### Phase 2: Backend Development
1. Set up Express.js server with middleware
2. Implemented database connection and models
3. Created authentication system with JWT
4. Developed RESTful APIs for all entities
5. Added input validation and error handling

### Phase 3: Frontend Development
1. Created responsive HTML templates
2. Implemented authentication flow
3. Built dashboard for different user roles
4. Added leave request and approval workflows
5. Integrated calendar view for leave visualization

### Phase 4: Testing & Optimization
1. Manual testing of all user workflows
2. Cross-browser compatibility testing
3. Mobile responsiveness verification
4. Performance optimization for database queries
5. Security testing for authentication flows

## Key Features Implemented

### Authentication System
- Login/logout functionality
- Role-based route protection
- JWT token management
- Session handling

### Leave Management
- Leave request submission with validation
- Approval/rejection workflow for managers
- Leave balance tracking
- Multiple leave types support
- Calendar integration for date selection

### User Management

### Reporting & Analytics
- Leave usage statistics
- Team availability overview
- Individual leave balance tracking
- Request history and audit trail

## Code Quality Practices

### Error Handling
- Comprehensive try-catch blocks
- Proper HTTP status codes
- User-friendly error messages
- Database error handling

### Code Organization
- Modular architecture with separate routes
- Configuration management with environment variables
- Separation of concerns (routes, middleware, models)
- Consistent naming conventions

### Documentation
- Inline code comments for complex logic
- API endpoint documentation
- Setup and deployment instructions
- Troubleshooting guides

## Performance Considerations

### Database Optimization
- Indexed columns for faster queries
- Efficient JOIN operations
- Connection pooling for SQLite
- Query optimization for dashboard data

### Frontend Performance
- Minimized DOM manipulations
- Efficient event handling
- Lazy loading for calendar views
- Optimized CSS for fast rendering

## Challenges Solved

1. **Date Handling**: Implemented proper timezone handling and date validation
2. **Role-based Access**: Created flexible permission system
3. **Leave Balance Calculation**: Automated balance updates with request approvals
4. **Cross-platform Compatibility**: Ensured SQLite works across different OS
5. **User Experience**: Created intuitive interfaces for non-technical users

## Future Enhancements

- Email notifications for leave requests
- Integration with calendar systems (Google Calendar, Outlook)
- Advanced reporting with charts and graphs
- Bulk leave operations
- Holiday calendar integration
- Mobile app development

## Testing Strategy

### Manual Testing Scenarios
1. User registration and login flows
2. Leave request submission and approval
3. Role-based access verification
4. Data validation and error handling
5. Cross-browser functionality
6. Mobile responsiveness

### Security Testing
1. Authentication bypass attempts
2. SQL injection prevention
3. XSS protection verification
4. CSRF token implementation
5. Password security validation

## Deployment Considerations

- Environment-based configuration
- Database migration strategies
- Production security hardening
- Backup and recovery procedures
- Monitoring and logging setup
